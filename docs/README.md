# fastdocs

Automatically generated [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) flavored documentation sites for your markdown files! We are a README-as-a-Service project, spin up beautiful versions of your documentation in seconds! And the best part? We are completely free and open-source!

## Getting Started

### Compile your docs

To add your repo documentation to FastDocs, you would need to visit `/:user/:repo/compile` first. This allows us to store your `README.md` and add [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) to render it.

You need to visit this compile endpoint everytime you would like your fastdocs to be updated.

### View your docs

Once you have compiled your docs, you can view and share the pretty version of your docs at `/:user/:repo/`!

That's it, it's that simple and fast!
